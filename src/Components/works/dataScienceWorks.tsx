          Key Training Settings
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Training Epochs: The number of times the model sees the entire training dataset. More epochs generally lead to better performance.</li>
          <li>Batch Size: The number of tickets processed together during training. This balances training speed with resource usage.</li>
          <li>Optimizer: The algorithm that adjusts the model&apos;s internal workings to improve accuracy.</li>
          <li>Learning Rate: Controls how quickly the model learns from training data.</li>
          <li>Fine-Tuning for Customer Service (if applicable): LoRA Parameters adjust a special technique for adapting the model to specific tasks like customer service tickets.</li>
          <li>Training Efficiency Techniques: Techniques like gradient accumulation, weight decay, precision (fp16/bf16), and learning rate scheduling improve training performance.</li>
          <li>Optimizing Customer Service Interactions: LoRA integration adapts the model for customer service tickets, and grouping by length trains it more efficiently.</li>
          <li>Maximum Generated Text: Limits the length of the model&apos;s responses to keep them focused and relevant.</li>
          <li>Text Generation Control: Controls like maximum gradient norm, training steps, and text generation parameters ensure stability and relevance in responses.</li>
          <li>Conclusion: Large language models are transforming customer service by automating tasks and personalizing responses, ensuring powerful adaptability for real-world use cases.</li>
